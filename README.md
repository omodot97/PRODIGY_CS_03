A password complexity checker is a tool or algorithm that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria, such as:

1. Length: Minimum number of characters required.
2. Character mix: Combination of:
    - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    - Lowercase letters (a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)
3. Uniqueness: Password should not be easily guessable or similar to common passwords.
4. Sequence: Password should not contain sequential characters (e.g., "123456" or "abcdefg").
5. Dictionary words: Password should not contain common dictionary words or phrases.
6. Personal information: Password should not contain personal information (e.g., name, birthdate, address).
7. History: Password should not be a previously used password.

The password complexity checker assigns a score or rating based on how well the password meets these criteria, indicating its strength and resistance to guessing or cracking. This helps users create strong, unique passwords and ensures password security.

Common password complexity checker criteria include:

- Password length: 8-12 characters
- Uppercase letters: at least 1
- Lowercase letters: at least 1
- Numbers: at least 1
- Special characters: at least 1
- No sequential characters
- No dictionary words
- No personal information

Note that password complexity checkers may vary in their specific criteria and scoring systems.
